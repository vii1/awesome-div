# Contribution Guidelines

> Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

> This guide is based off the [awesome-gbdev contribution guide](https://github.com/gbdev/awesome-gbdev/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Before sending a Pull Request or opening an Issue, ensure it adheres to the following guidelines and policies.

Search previous suggestions and open issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.

Here's how you can contribute:

- Look at open [Issues](https://github.com/vii1/awesome-div/issues) and provide help or feedback 
- [Add a resource](#adding-a-resource)
- [Correct and improve existing entries](#correcting-and-improving-resources)
- [Fix broken links and unavailable resources](#removing-unavailable-resources)
- [Discuss on what should and shouldn't go on the list](https://github.com/vii1/awesome-div/issues), the 'awesome' quality standard

## Adding a resource

### Is it "awesome"?

For a resource to be added to the list, it must...

- Be in a minimal working state;
- Have a clear purpose (implementation reference is okay, too) and/or provide something interesting;
- Provide a minimal documentation briefly describing what is the project and how to make use of it.

If the resource is still work in progress, abandoned or you don't think reaches the described standard BUT it's still related to DIV you can add it to the **MORE.md** file.

### Pull Request

- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[resource](link) - Description.`
- If the resource is not in English, add a [two-letter language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) encased in parentheses before the description. Example: `[resource](link) - (ES) Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are appreciated. You're welcome to discuss discrimination and categorization criteria in Issues/PRs.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive, pointing out the particularities or major features of the resource.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- It's `DIV`, not `Div` or `div`, however, you should honor the title or name of the resource while linking it, even if it's using a wrong lettering.

If you are not confident in forking the repository, making the change and sending the PR, don't hesitate to open an Issue describing the addition (or the change you want to make/discuss).

Before the PR gets approved and merged, we may require a number of reviews from our contributors.

## Correcting and improving resources

Most of the linked resources are hosted on Git repositories. You are encouraged to report errors in the corresponding upstream repository or contact the authors. If the correction doesn't get merged, fork it and mantain an updated/correct version and open a PR replacing the link on the list with your version.

In any case, open an Issue mentioning the error and its magnitude. This can have two outcomes:

- If the resource is unique/important - while we wait for the error getting corrected in the upstream source - we add an Errata notice next near the link. OR
- The resource gets moved in MORE, until it reaches a decent/maintanable/correct state.

If you think something doesn't fit the list, open an Issue or a PR mentioning the reasons.

## Removing unavailable resources

You're welcome to remove any broken link in the repository, but first try to find a reliable mirror and replace it:

- Check on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/) and Google Cache;
- Try the GitHub search.

Then, **open an Issue** with any useful details.

You can then proceed to remove the broken link (or wait for someone to do it).

If you have some old and unavailable resource (not necessarly listed in the missing list) archived in your hard disk that maybe in the interest (even historical!) of the DIV community, please open an Issue attaching or linking the resource.

#### Thank you!
